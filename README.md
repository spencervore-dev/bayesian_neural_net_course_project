# README #

This repo contains code and documentation for my ISYE6420 Bayesian Statistics course project at Georgia Tech.


### Project Summary ###
To be determined once it's completed


### Installation and Setup ###

I installed this in a conda environment on a Fedora 38 system. The PyMC documentation says it's available on conda-forge, so I used a conda virtual enviroment 
to be consistent with the PyMC documentation and get it working easy. Python 3.11.6 was used.
On Fedora, I needed to install gcc to solve error saying g++ not detected.
``` sudo dnf install gcc-c++ ```

WARNING: It is a bit tricky to get a working PyMC Python environment. Also, PyMC tends to have breaking changes fairly often, so this could all be outdated if you try a different version. The course website has some useful PyMC troubleshooting tips:
https://areding.github.io/6420-pymc/unit6/Unit6-probabilisticprogramming.html

First, create a PyMC python enviroment using the instructions on the PyMC website here: https://www.pymc.io/projects/docs/en/latest/installation.html

I was having some issues getting jupyterlab also installed. I think there is some versioning issue with conda-forge going on at the moment that will hopefully clear up at some point.

Then, install additional required third party libraries using conda. It works best if everything is installed
with the same python package manager.

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```

Once the enviroment is set up, launch jupyter notebooks by typing:

``` jupyter lab ```
